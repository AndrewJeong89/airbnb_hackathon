# airbnb_hackathon

## Summary

This repo looks at airbnb listings and calendars from [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Converting the calendar scrapes from days to month and imputing average monthly prices per listing, a dynamic pricing model is performed using Gradient Boosting using sklearn library in Python. The user inputs the following variables: month, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, number of reviews, and rating. These are the inputs into the pricing model. The result is the expected price from the model. 

Based on the month and bedroom inputs, the min, max, median, and mean neighborhood prices are also calculated, giving the user prices for other neighborhoods. Adding in neighborhood input, the listings for all three inputs (month, bedroom, neighborhood) are shown.
